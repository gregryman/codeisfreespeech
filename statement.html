<p>SACRAMENTO, CA (July 31, 2018) &mdash; Tonight, the organizations and individuals behind <a href="http://codeisfreespeech.com/">CodeIsFreeSpeech.com</a>, a new Web site for the publication and sharing of firearm-related speech, including machine code, have issued the following statement:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Constitution&rsquo;s First Amendment secures the right of all people to engage in truthful speech, including by sharing information contained in books, paintings, and files. Indeed, freedom of speech is a bedrock principle of our United States and a cornerstone of our democratic Republic. Through <a href="http://codeisfreespeech.com/">CodeIsFreeSpeech.com</a>, we intend to encourage people to consider new and different aspects of our nation&rsquo;s marketplace of ideas &ndash; even if some government officials disagree with our views or dislike our content &ndash; because information is code, code is free speech, and free speech is freedom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should any tyrants wish to chill or infringe the rights of the People, we would welcome the opportunity to defend freedom whenever, wherever, and however necessary. Hand-waving and hyperbole are not compelling government interests and censorship is not proper tailoring under the law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed have inspired countless Americans to exercise their fundamental, individual rights, including through home gunsmithing. Through <a href="http://codeisfreespeech.com/">CodeIsFreeSpeech.com</a>, we hope to promote the collection and dissemination of truthful, non-misleading speech, new and evolving ideas, and the advancement of the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.&nbsp;</p>
